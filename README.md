- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m JC,
- I have no experienc with computer science but the reason I joined this class is because I think that in the future (and currently in the present) there will be
- more and more open doors for me if I have at least a basic knowledge of computer science and what it entails. I have also always had an interest in computer science and coding
- so I think that I will enjoy this class.
